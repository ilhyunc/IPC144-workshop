1. Execute the above sample code on your machine. Briefly explain why price1 and the corresponding converted
cent value does not properly represent the intended value. Why do you think all the other samples work as
expected?
 - Because computers do finite numbers of calculations, errors occur.  Depending on how many decimal places can be expressed, 
the error range is reduced and more precise calculations are possible. Double type can be calculated by expressing more decimal points than float type. 
Therefore, when using the double type, the error range is further reduced.

2. Explain why these three examples work as intended. Apply terms like cast, promotion, coercion, implicit, and
explicit in your answer.
- money / 100.0,
money / (double)100, 
(double)money / 100  
All three methods above can be coercioned to cast in double type. The reason for using 100.0 instead of 100 is to change to a dual type to display decimal points instead of integers.

3. Apply terms like cast, promotion, truncation, coercion, implicit, and explicit in answering the following
questions.
a) What is the value of the variable result? Explain why.
 - Since the int type variable was used, the two decimal places are rounded to 72.

b) What values are displayed for samples 1, 2, 3, and 4?
 - 1. $0.00
   2. $72 
   3. $0.00
   4. $72 

c) What can you conclude about the printf function that causes samples 1 and 3 not to work as expected?
 - int type was declared, but the output became 0.00 up to two decimal places because it tried to use a decimal point. If i use '%d' instead of '%.2lf', 72 is output.
