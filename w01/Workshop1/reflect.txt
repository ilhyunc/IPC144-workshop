1. Do you have any previous programming experience? If so, what language(s)? If not, what are your initial
thoughts about the C language and this course?
- I have no experience. I learned that language C is the origin of programming language. I want to learn the basic C language clearly.

2. Describe your understanding of the compiling process of turning a C text file into an executable program.
- I compile the code I wrote through Visual Studio and convert it into a language that the CPU can understand, 
i.e. compilation converts the source code written in a human-understandable language into a language that the CPU can understand.

3. What do you hope to achieve in this course? Describe your goals and expectations.
- I will definitely study C language, and prepare for many more languages to learn in the future.
