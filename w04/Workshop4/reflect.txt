1. With the completion of this workshop, you must have begun to appreciate why code formatting is important. 
Explain how you made your code – especially the iteration and selection logic parts – easy to read and maintain.


do
    {
        printf("Grocery Shopping\n");
        printf("================\n");
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    } while (repeat);

- Do-while iterator were used, and the condition of the iterator was set to 'repeat'. The value of 'repeat' was changed to escape from the iterator .



2. Nested logic is an important feature of programming in any language. Identify and briefly discuss the biggest 
impact on how this workshop could be coded if nesting were not possible.

- It repeats the same format, but the product name is different. So I copied and pasted the code and changed the product name one by one to complete the work.




3. Consider the following scenario: you are programming logic that requires a user to input a value between 1 and 
5, and for each value within that range, you had to perform something unique. You would have to apply 
selection to validate the entered values so you can implement the given logic for a specific entered range value. 
Explain why is it inefficient to achieve this using a series of “if” optional path constructs instead of the preferred 
“if/else if…” alternative path logic?

-The number of cases is 5 from 1 to 5. If there are more cases than this, I will have to repeat 'else if' several times.
In this case, it seems better to use 'switch' to distinguish the conditions by case.
