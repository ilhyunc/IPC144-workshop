1. The three types of iteration constructs are for loops, while loops, and do-while loops. All three of these constructs can be used to iterate through an array and perform operations on each element.  
For loops are the most commonly used iteration construct when working with arrays because they allow for the initialization of a counter, a conditional check for completion, and finally an increment of the counter all within the same line. 
This allows for more control over the loop and makes it easier to read and understand what the loop is doing. 
While loops and do-while loops can also be used but they are less preferred as they require the counter to be initialized and updated outside of the loop.

2. 
- When there is a syntax error, program will not compile.
I actively used compiler error messages to find syntax errors such as missing ';' and brackets. 
If I missed something necessary syntactically, the program doesn't work and I can check what, where and why it is wrong by double clicking the error messages.
(This is more like a spelling error)
Semantic error is like a grammar error, it will compile but the meaning or logic should be changed.
When I enter input data beyond the coverage I set, I designed to come up with error messages. But, sometimes it doesn't work well.
There were a few reasons such as incorrect operator order(incorrect range) and using wrong variables. 
I checked these problems with IDE debugging. I made breakpoints at the sentence which I thought was wrong.
And by pressing 'F5', I started debugging. By pressing 'F10', I could progress to the next sentence.
I could check if it was saved correct numbers in exact variables by this process.
If an unintended number was stored in a variable, I could know what was wrong by 'walkthroughs' before the breakpoint.


3. 
1) Open the two files, output.txt and w6p2_master_output.txt, provided in the directory.
2) Compare the two files side-by-side to identify the difference between the two outputs.
3) An error occurs because the submitted output is printing $567.89, while the correct output should be printing $0.
4) To identify the source of the error, go to the line of code where the output is being printed and locate the scanf statement.
5) Modify the scanf statement to prompt for an integer instead of a double.
6) Re-run the program and re-submit the output.
