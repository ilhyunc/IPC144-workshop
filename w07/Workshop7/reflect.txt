1. I accomplished this by using a for-loop to draw the ruler and board, and using another for-loop to move the player position. I used an array to store the values changed the character '-' to another character and .
 I used a method of changing the value in the array to mark the location and then filled in the space and marked the V character at the end.

2. Structures allow us to store related data in one place, making it easier to access and manipulate.By using structures, all the related data can be organized and stored in one place, 
making the program easier to read and understand. Additionally, by using structures, it is much easier to create reusable code, since similar data can be accessed using the same code. 
Furthermore, using structures can simplify debugging and troubleshooting, since all related data can be found in the same place.

3. 5 levels of nesting.
    do //level 1
    {
        do //level 2
        {
            if (player1.lives != 0 && game.moves != 0) //level 3
            {
                do //level 4
                {
                    if (position < 1 || position > game.pathLength) // level 5
                    {
                    }
                } while (rangeRepeat);
            }
        } while (moveRepeat);
    } while (repeat);
