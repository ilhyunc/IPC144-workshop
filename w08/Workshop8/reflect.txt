1. 
 One benefit of having functions designed to return values via an argument and/or by return is flexibility.
It allows the user to choose how they want the function to be used, either as an argument or by a return, 
depending on the user's preference or specific needs. This makes the code more reusable and efficient as the user can use it in different ways.
One negative reason having a function designed to work in this way may not be desirable is that it can make the code less readable. 
The user may find themselves unsure which returning method is being used in a given function call, making the code difficult to debug 
and maintain.

2. 
 Function getIntPositive()
This function could be improved by increasing its cohesion. Currently, it only gets user input and validates it, 
but it could also do the job of assigning the input to the pointer argument. This would reduce the number of lines in the main() function, 
making it easier to read and reducing the amount of code.

 Function displayCatFoodData()
This function could be improved by reducing its coupling. Currently, it takes four parameters, which all need to be passed from the main() function. 
It could be improved by passing a pointer to a structure, instead of passing four parameters. This would reduce the amount of code in the main() function, 
making it easier to read, and reduce the number of parameters needed for this function.

3.
Advantages of passing structures to functions are that passing structures to functions allows for a large amount of information to be passed to a single function rather than having to pass individual pieces of data to different functions. 
By passing structures, a user is able to pass multiple pieces of data with a single function call.
The “displayCatfoodData” function could be improved by utilizing pointers and pass by reference. By passing the data by reference, 
we can avoid making a copy of the data and reducing the amount of data that needs to be passed. By utilizing pointers, 
the data can be updated and display the changes from within the function. 
Additionally, the function could be improved by utilizing a structure to pass the data to the function instead of passing the individual pieces of data. 
This would reduce the amount of data that needs to be passed to the function and reduce the complexity of the function.
